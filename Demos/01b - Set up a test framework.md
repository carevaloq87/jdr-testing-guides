*App contains a basic Javascript class for a calculator with add, subtract, multiply, divide*

1. Pull the practicals repository from `https://github.com/juniordevio/testing-testing-123`
1. It's currently pretty bare-bones: we'll work up to a fuller app later
1. For now, let's establish some test files
1. Add Mocha and Chai from NPM
1. Add a tests folder
1. Add a calculator-tests.js file
1. Run your (empty) test suite! Set up a shortcut to mocha in your package.json so you can run `npm test`, or just run `mocha`
