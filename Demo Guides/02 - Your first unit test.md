# Practical 2 - Your first unit test

## Objectives
* Get access to your production code & test libraries within your test code
* Use `describe` and `it` blocks to create a test fixture
* Write a basic test which enforces a happy-case scenario
* Run the test suite with a green result

### Extensions
* Write edge-cases for unexpected input
* Write a test and then production code to handle invalid inputs

## Set-up Steps
1. Commit any outstanding changes on your Prac01 branch: `git commit -am 'Some message'`
1. Head back over to master: `git checkout master`
1. Check out the Start Point for Prac 2: `git checkout Prac02-StartPoint`
    - This references a defined tag in the repository, you must use exactly this name
1. Create a branch to make your changes on without impacting the main repo: `git checkout -b Prac02`
    - This branch is your own working space, you can call it anything you want
