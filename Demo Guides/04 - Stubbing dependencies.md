# Practical 4 - Stubbing Dependencies

## Objectives
* Identify dependencies to be controlled when testing production code
* Install a stub library & get access to it in your test code
* Stub out a method on a dependency to control its return value
* Use test set-up and tear-down hooks to perform repetitive tasks

## Extensions
* Write a test for code with multiple dependencies

## Set-up steps
Same pattern as previous pracs
1. Commit any outstanding changes on your Prac03 branch: `git commit -am 'Some message'`
1. Head back over to master: `git checkout master`
1. Check out the Start Point for Prac 4: `git checkout Prac04-StartPoint`
1. Create a branch to make your changes on without impacting the main repo: `git checkout -b Prac04`
