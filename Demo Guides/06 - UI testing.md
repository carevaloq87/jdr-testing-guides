# Practical 6 - UI Testing

## Objectives
* Install WebDriver and ChromeDriver, and get access to them in test code
* Spin up a web browser pointing to the system
* Use locators to assert on expected page text
* Use locators to navigate to a new page

## Extensions
* Use locators to fill form values
* Use locators to submit a form
* Write test cases for happy-path functionality

## Set-up Steps
Same pattern as previous pracs
1. Commit any outstanding changes on your Prac02 branch: `git commit -am 'Some message'`
1. Head back over to master: `git checkout master`
1. Check out the Start Point for Prac 3: `git checkout Prac06-StartPoint`
1. Create a branch to make your changes on without impacting the main repo: `git checkout -b Prac06`
